            Before social media, people used letters, phone calls, and emails to stay in touch. The internet changed everything by making communication faster and easier. Social media took this a step further by letting people share their lives with many others at once. It’s now a tool for friends, businesses, and even news. This evolution is exciting to explore.

            The history of social media goes back further than most people think. It didn’t start with Facebook or Twitter but with much simpler ideas. In the 1970s and 1980s, people used bulletin board systems (BBS) to post messages online. These were like early chat rooms where users shared ideas or files. Then, in the 1990s, websites like Six Degrees let people create profiles and connect with friends. This was the first step toward modern social media. Over time, technology improved, and more people got online. By the 2000s, platforms like MySpace and Friendster became popular. Today, social media is everywhere, shaping how we talk, work, and play. It’s a big change from where it all began.
