            Then came MySpace in 2003. It was colorful and let users customize their pages. People could add music, photos, and more. MySpace became a huge hit, especially with teens.ySpace changed social media in a big way. Before it, platforms were simple and plain. MySpace let users show their personality with bright backgrounds and songs. By 2006, it was the most visited site in the U.S., beating even Google. People used it to make friends, share art, and even find bands.

            Friendster was popular too, but it had technical problems and faded. MySpace felt like a party online—everyone wanted to join. At its peak, it had over 100 million users. But it didn’t last forever; new sites were coming. Still, it showed how fun social media could be. The 2000s were a wild time online.
