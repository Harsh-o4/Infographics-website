        Social media didn’t begin with fancy apps. In the 1970s, people used something called <b>bulletin board systems, or BBS</b>. These were basic online spaces where users could leave messages. It was slow, but it was a start.

            By the 1990s, the internet was growing fast. Websites like <b>Six Degrees</b> appeared in 1997. It let people make profiles and list their friends. This was the <b>first real social network</b>, even if it was simple.

            The early days of social media were very different from today. Back then, <b>only a few people had computers</b>, and the internet was slow. Bulletin board systems needed a phone line to connect, and <b>you could only talk to a small group</b>. Still, it was exciting because it was new. Then came Six Degrees, named after the idea that everyone is connected by six people or fewer. Users could send messages and see their friends’ profiles.

            Other early sites popped up too, like <b>Classmates</b>.com. It helped people find old school friends. These platforms were limited but showed a growing interest. The world was getting ready for more.

        The 1990s ended with the internet booming. Early social media was basic, but it planted seeds. Soon, <b>bigger and better platforms would take over</b>. The next page will show how!
